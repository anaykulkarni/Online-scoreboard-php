# Online-scoreboard-php
The GuitarWars online scoreboard application provides a platform for the players to post their high score online along with a screenshot. The scores are added only after they are validated by the admin. The highest score is hoisted to the top and highlighted. This application includes both - the webpages for maintenance(used by the admin) and webpages for the end users. The admin pages are protected by HTTP authentication. The application was developed using HTML, CSS and PHP.
